# Security Control Categories

## Introduction
- Cybersecurity is crucial for business risk management.
- IT departments often implement cybersecurity functions.
- IT service frameworks provide best practice guides.
- Security controls are procedures, activities, and tools for cybersecurity.
- These controls aim to ensure **confidentiality**, **integrity**, **availability**, and **non-repudiation** of systems and data.

## Four Categories of Security Controls

Security controls are categorized by how they are implemented:

1.  **Managerial Controls**
    - Provide oversight of information systems.
    - Examples:
        - **Risk identification processes**.
        - Tools for **evaluating and selecting other security controls.**

2.  **Operational Controls**
    - Implemented primarily by people.
    - Examples:
        - **Security guards**.
        - **Security awareness training programs.**

3.  **Technical Controls**
    - Implemented as systems (hardware, software, or firmware).
    - Examples:
        - **Firewalls.**
        - **Antivirus software.**
        - **OS access control models.**

4.  **Physical Controls**
    - Deter and detect access to premises and hardware.
    - Examples:
        - **Security cameras.**
        - **Alarms.**
        - **Locks.**
        - **Security guards.**
        - **Lighting.**

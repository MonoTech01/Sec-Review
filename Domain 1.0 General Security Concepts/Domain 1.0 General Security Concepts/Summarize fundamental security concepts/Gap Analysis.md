# Gap Analysis in Cybersecurity

## Introduction

- Security functions have associated goals or outcomes.
- Outcomes are achieved by implementing security controls.
- Selecting effective controls from numerous options is challenging.
- Cybersecurity frameworks guide control selection and configuration.

## Importance of Frameworks

-   Frameworks prevent building security programs in isolation.
-   They ensure consideration of crucial security concepts.
-   Frameworks enable organizations to:
    -   Objectively state current cybersecurity capabilities.
    -   Identify a target level of capability.
    -   Prioritize investments to reach the target.
    -   Structure internal risk management.
    -   Provide an externally verifiable statement of regulatory compliance.

## What is Gap Analysis?

-   **Definition:** A process that identifies deviations between an organization's security systems and the requirements/recommendations of a framework.
-   Performed when:
    -   First adopting a framework.
    -   Meeting new industry or legal compliance requirements.
    -   Periodically (e.g., every few years) for compliance validation or framework updates.

## Gap Analysis Process

1.  **Framework Selection:** Choose an appropriate cybersecurity framework.
2.  **Assessment:** Evaluate current security controls against the chosen framework.
3.  **Identification:** Identify gaps where controls are missing or poorly configured.
4.  **Reporting:** Create a detailed gap analysis report including:
    -   Overall score for each section of the framework.
    -   Detailed list of missing/poorly configured controls.
    -   Recommendations for remediation.

## Gap Analysis Report Contents

-   **Summary of Findings:**
    -   Number of recommended controls *not implemented* per function and category.
    -   Risks to *confidentiality, integrity, and availability* from missing controls.
    -   Target *remediation dates*.

## Example Table (Gap Analysis Findings)

| Security Function | Category  | Missing Controls | Risks              | Target Remediation |
|-------------------|-----------|------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Identify          | Asset Mgmt| 5                | CIA breach         | 2024-09-30        |
| Protect           | Access Ctl| 3                | Data exposure     | 2024-10-15        |
| Detect            | Monitoring| 2                | Undetected attacks| 2024-11-01        |
| Respond           | IR Plan   | 1                | Ineffective response | 2024-12-01        |
| Recover           | Backup    | 2                | Data loss        | 2025-01-15       |

## Third-Party Involvement

-   Gap analysis often involves third-party consultants due to:
    -   Complexity of frameworks and compliance requirements.
    -   Need for specialist knowledge.
    -   Objective advice and feedback.
    -   Alerting to oversights and new trends.

## Benefits of Using Third Party Consultants

-   External view and objectivity
-   Knowledge of frameworks and compliance requirements
-   Experience of other similar gap analysis projects

## Summary

- Gap analysis helps identify areas needing improvement in cybersecurity.
- It compares an organization's existing security posture with a chosen framework.
- It provides a structured approach for enhancing security and achieving compliance.
- Third-party consultants bring expertise and objectivity to the process.

## Actionable Items

1.  Research some popular cybersecurity frameworks, like NIST CSF, CIS Controls, or ISO 27001.
2.  Consider a scenario where you are tasked with performing a gap analysis. What initial steps would you take before the assessment?
3.  Why is using an external third party beneficial for this process?
